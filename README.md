### About This Project
**You can control the light in my room** via a LoRa device using the interface linked below.

[LoRa Device Control](https://kazu-ricefield.github.io/loraDeviceControl/)

### Purpose
This demonstration proposes a secure and versatile next-generation remote monitoring and control system using LoRaWAN. The ultimate goal is not the web interface itself, but to incorporate LoRaWAN into SCADA systems using IP-VPN or other private network infrastructures.

By sharing this demo on the internet, I aim to showcase the potential of this system to a wider audience.

### How to Use
Visit the [LoRa Device Control](https://kazu-ricefield.github.io/loraDeviceControl/) page and simply click **"Turn ON"** or **"Turn OFF"** to control the light in my room. You can verify the result via a YouTube live stream.

- **Time Lag**: There is a slight delay in the live stream. Please compare the time shown on the webpage (from your local device) with the time on the live stream (JST/UTC+9) to check the result.
- **Response Time**: The light will typically turn on or off within 2 seconds of your action. The YouTube stream delay is usually 5 to 10 seconds. If the delay is longer, please refresh the page.
